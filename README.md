     1. Non linear dynamic: 
     This file contain 7 matlab files. the main file is "non_linear_vib.m"
     this is a part of Graphical user interface. hence after running "non_linear_vib.m" 
     an interface gets open which asked the required input and gives the necessary output.
     
     2. Standalone Application:
